## Modals

The Modal takes a blockWrap and appends it to the body of the html document, then displays it when a specified item is clicked. Depending on the task, the modals may have to work differently. 

### Current methods:

1. Modal that houses video
2. Modal that houses an image gallery

#### Steps 

1. copy and paste the css and js into their respective places.
2. in the JS: specify the page this modal is for, change out the triggers and targets. trigger refers to the block that contains the item to be clicked. the target refers to the block that contains the modal content.

#### Troubleshooting

1. make sure you are using the correct css files. the image gallery modal has to work differently than other modals, because the block can't be hidden before Flexslider loads.

#### Live Examples
